        <h2 id="1">1. Fooling around with text...</h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, you can use a whole array of different tags to add special effects to text!
            An example of this is using "b and /b" to <b>bold</b> text.
            <i>Italics</i> are neat too (That's "i, /i")!
            One musn't forget about <ins>underlined</ins> text, done with "ins" and "/ins"
            If you've got something that you wanna cross out, try <del>strikethrough</del>, which is "del, /del".
            Need to do something sciency? Try <small>"small"</small>. Great for all that H<small>2</small>O in your life. Done simply with the "small, /small" tag. If you want to superscript somthing, simply use <sup>"sup"</sup>. <mark>Highlighting can be done too, with "mark, /mark".</mark>
            There are some others, such as <em>emphasis</em> and <strong>stronk</strong>, but I really don't notice a difference between them and italics/bold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now one can change the size and colour of text!
            Colour is changed with "style, /style", and colours can be set in stylesheets, or added for each individual instance, as needed.
            There are a whole slew of colours in HTML, such as <b style="color: aqua">aqua</b> and <b style="color: coral">coral</b>, and again, colours can be applied to anything from a single letter to your whole page! Even backgrounds can use colours... I won't get into size for the sake of keeping this page somewhat nice looking, and this text uniform, but you can do a whole bunch with it.
