        <h1 style="background-color: aqua">Some food for thought:</h1> <!-- Hey look you found this comment! -->
        <p  style="border: 2px solid Black;">The real question is, what separates "head" from "body"? Is it the neck? Head is apparently "Metadata" about the page - I guess it's optional.</p>
        <p>Also, why does the page title belong in "head" - why isn't it fine by itself like it was before? Same answer as before. Maybe there's more you can do in "head"?</p>
        <p>Does everything belong in body? Can one have multiple bodies? What is the purpose of body? Looks like everything else belongs in "body". I guess you could have multiple bodies, but there isn't really a point, unless you want to separate code perhaps? yes, the website states "The visible part of the HTML document is in between "body" and "/body"</p>
        <p id="p01">Apparently you can use HTML with programs like Notepad - I bet they don't auto complete tags though, do they?</p>
        <h2>Looks like the number of the heading defines it's import - what does that mean?</h2>
        <p>Looks like a heading's importance equates to it's size. "h6" will have smaller text than "h1"</p>
        <p>Looks like you can add links too! Check this one out...</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Can you hide the link under text? Looks like you can!</a><br>
        <a href="resources/oof.png">local links are a thing too it seems...</a><br>
        <img src="resources/oof.png" alt="What's this?" width="100" height="100">
        <p>Images are pretty neat too!</p>
        <p>Remember: "p" by itself will start a new line! Useful for images, links, and anything not between "p" and "/p"</p><p>
        <button>This is a button?</button>
        <p>That's pretty neat. There's gotta be a way to put a link in it!</p>
        <p>Lists are neat, they come in multiple flavours. There's the bulleted list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Something here...</li><!-- Sorry, gotta quarentine this one...
            <li>Something here as well...</li>-->
            <li>And something here...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lists can also be numbered...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Like so...</li>
            <li>Aren't lists so cool?</li>
            <li>I wonder how many numbers it can go up to?</li>
            <li>Probably a lot. My guess is something huge like 20.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now we move on to elements... Looks like I've been using one all along - it's "p" and "/p"!</p>
        <p>So you know what I said above about using "p" to break lines? Turns out that's <i>kinda</i> illegal. The website suggests that you "never rely on empty elements that are usually closed, like "p", which is usually ended with "/p". From now on, use "br" to indicate a line break!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="error">I am not ashamed to abuse what I have.</p>
        <p>Anyways, try and stick to lowercase. This is "customary". </p>
        <p>Attributes are a thing. It seems they've been used before when adding a link, all that "href" jazz. I'd bet good money that "src", "alt" (whatever that does) and "width"/"height" are attributes as well.</p>
        <p>Looks like I was right! Now as for the "alt" attribute... it displays text when an image can not be found. The website uses the example of someone listening to the webpage with text to speech - when it gets to the image above, the program will say whatever I put in alt, in this case "What's this?". Could be useful.</p>
        <p style="color: aqua">"Style" seems rather interesting as well, if you can't tell. Looks like you can also change font size with it... lemme try that...</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30">Big font for a big boy?</p>
        <p title='You found the secret! This is the attribute "title" which is used with "p" in this case! Do not forget that you can use single and double quotation marks!'>Now if you look waaay back to the top of the page, you'll notice that I added a language to the doc - again, that's for people who listen to a page.</p>
        <p>I bet you could add a title to a link - maybe that's what they do in Wikipedia!</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Don't listen to what the link says!">Click me or die!</a>
        <h2>Apparently search engines use headings to index your page! People use them too of course...</h2>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30">You can change heading size too: Big text for a big boy 2: Electric Boogaloo.</h2>
        <p>Now watch this!</p>
        <hr title='This is "hr", it adds vertical slashes, so you can organize your page!'>
        <p>Does it work with titles? Looks like it does...</p>
        <pre>
        The HTML "pre"
        
        Defines preformatted text
        
        So you can do things like this
        
        Without having to put "br" between each line
        
        Cool, isn't it?
        </pre>
        <p>Remember: You can add styles to almost anything (Or so it seems), including the body section! Make your page look snazzy!</p>
        <p style="font-family: cursive">Here's some snazzy text! It's done with the "font-family" style.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">Four score and seven years ago, our ancestors learned how to align text with "text-align". I bet this would work with images as well. Proper wiki, here we come!</p>
        <b>Here's some bolded text, cause we need to take a break from all those "styles".</b><br>
        <i>Italics are important too.</i><br>
        What the difference between them and <em>emphasized</em> text is, I can't say.<br>
        I know not what <strong>stronk</strong> text does either. What is semantic importance?<br>
        Want some <small>smaller text?</small><br>
        Maybe you want to <mark>highlight the text that's important</mark><br>
        <del>scratch that - "del" is where it's at!</del><br>
        Or maybe <ins>"ins"</ins> is more to your taste? Care to fill in the <pre><ins>     </ins></pre>?<br>
        Maybe <small>"small" isn't</small><sub>small enough.</sub><br>
        What if you want to <sup>supersize that script? Or was it superscript that size?</sup><br>
        <hr>
        <p>What if you need to quote something? For instance, <q>Houston, we have an issue...</q></p>
        <p>Now that's all fun and good - but if you've got a lot of text to quote, try "blockquote" instead of "q".</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">I'm making up a quote, but I'm saying it outloud to myself right now, so it's technically a quote.</blockquote>
        <p>Abbreviations are useful, because frankly, who wants to say "Never Gonna Give You Up?" over and over again? Instead, try <abbr title="Never Gonna Give You Up">NGGYU</abbr> which isn't funny anymore, and people who use it have no understanding of comedy. Please send all complaints to: </p>

        <p>Now I know students just <em>love</em> to cite their sources. How would one do that? It's easy, just learn it over on <cite>w3schools.com</cite>, or look at this code!</p>
